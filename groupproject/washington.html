        northwestern corner of the 48 conterminous states, it is bounded by the Canadian province of British Columbia to
        the
        north, the U.S. states of Idaho to the east and Oregon to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The
        capital
        is Olympia, located at the southern end of Puget Sound in the western part of the state. The state’s coastal
